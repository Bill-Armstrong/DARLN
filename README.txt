About ALNfitDeep:

Here is open-source machine learning software that everyone can use because it is COMPLETELY AUTOMATED.  You just say which tab-separated file of numbers contains your data. If the right-hand column is the one to be learned, you just click on Start and the ALNfitDeep program does the rest. All parameters are set AUTOMATICALLY. The architecture grows AUTOMATICALLY to fit the problem until you have a solution. Overtraining is avoided by estimating the noise level in the data and not growing the architecture when it tends to learn noise. The DEEP LEARNING algorithm is extremely fast in both learning and execution.

The program can do:
 
non-linear, non-parametric regression
filling in of missing values in data files
multiple time-series analysis
high-dimensional problems
identification of input variables that can be removed to improve results
classification into two classes

Most importantly, the ideas embodied in the software are key for the future development of DEEP learning.

Run the program and click on the Help button to start fitting your own data. 

This open-source project builds under Visual Studio 2015 Community (free) and makes use of C++ and Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC).  The solution (.sln) file is in the folder libaln/win32. Batch build the libaln and alnpp libraries first (10 items), then the ALNfitDeep and realestate items (6 items). The executable ALNfitDeep.exe appears in the libaln/samples/ALNfitDeep/Release directory. You should have a new folder to contain a copy of the program and your data files.
