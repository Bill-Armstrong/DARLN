# Coming Soon

ALNfitDeep is open-source machine learning software for MS Windows. This version will soon be replaced. The new version's main improvement is that it can handle a varying level of noise at different places in the domain of the unknown function. Please see the Word document in this directory for an example of how well noise variance stopping can improve neural net training.
