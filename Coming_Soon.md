# Coming Soon

ALNfitDeep is open-source machine learning software for Windows. This new version's main improvement is that it can handle a varying level of noise at different places in the domain of the unknown function. Please see the .png image in this directory for an example of how ALN learning with noise variance stopping can bring out details in the signal. The signal can be followed part of the way into a region of very high noise. You can experiment with a pre-release version v2.0alpha of the software. There is a Help button on the interface with instructions. You can generate some test files as per the descriptions of data files.
